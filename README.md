# Investigating Visual Attention in Hidden Object Games

Produced for my final year disseration and project at the University of Bath.

The primary focus of this study is saliency, image modulation and their affect on task difficulty. In order to investigate this, a hidden object style game has been developed as a more engaging environment for data collection. The study has shown that image modulation can reduce task difficulty, and that the hidden object game can serve as a test-bed for future visual studies.
